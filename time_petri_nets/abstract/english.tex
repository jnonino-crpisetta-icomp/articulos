	In this article, we present a Time Petri Nets Processor which is the evolution of Timed Petri 
	Nets Processor. This processor can be directly programmed using Petri Nets formalism's vectors 
	and matrixes. This processor can leverage the power of Petri Nets for modeling real-time systems
	and formally verifying their properties, which prevent programming errors.
	 
	The Petri Nets Processor was developed as an IP-core to be inserted in a multi-core system. 
	Therefore, we can model the system requirements with Petri Nets, formally verifying all its 
	properties and by using the IP-core to implement the system is possible to ensure that all 
	properties will be met.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
