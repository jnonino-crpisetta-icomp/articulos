\section{Objetives}

	\subsection{Main Objective} 
	The main objective of this work is to design and implement a Petri Nets Processor capable to 
	execute the Time Petri Nets semantics and to be programmed directly from the model's state 
	equations.
	
	\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
	The secondary objectives are:
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Briefly describe Time Petri Nets in order to implement a processor capable of execute them.
        \item Keep executing ordinary Petri Nets with time parameters on two processor clock cycles.
        \item Implement the Time Petri Nets Processor as an IP-core.
	\end{itemize}
