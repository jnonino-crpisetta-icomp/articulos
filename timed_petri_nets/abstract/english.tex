	In this article, we present a Timed Petri Nets processor wich can be can be directly programmed 
	using vectors and matrices of Petri Nets formalism. This processor can leverage the power of Petri
	Nets for modeling real-time systems and formally verify their properties, which prevent programming
	errors.
	\\
	
	The Petri Nets processor was developed as an IP-core to be inserted in a multi-core system.
	Therefore, we can model the system requirements with Petri Nets, formally verifying all its
	properties and using the IP-core to implement the system is possible to ensure that all properties
	will be met.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
