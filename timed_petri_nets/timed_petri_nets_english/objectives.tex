\section{Objectives}

	\subsection{Main Objective}
	
		The main objective of this work is to design and implement a Petri Nets Processor capable 
		to execute the Timed Petri Nets semantics and to be programmed directly from the model\'s 
		state equations.
	
	\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
	
		The secondary objectives are:
		\begin{itemize}
		  	\item Briefly describe Timed Petri Nets in order to implement a processor capable of execute 
		  		them.
		  	\item Keep executing ordinary Petri Nets with time parameters on two processor clock cycles.
		  	\item Implement the Timed Petri Nets processor as an IP-core.
		\end{itemize}
